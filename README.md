# URnetwork for Linux

Native Linux desktop client for amd64 and arm64. It is built from two
programs: a privileged daemon, `urnetworkd`, and an unprivileged GTK4 GUI,
`urnetwork-gui`. Releases are attached to the GitHub release on
[urnetwork/build](https://github.com/urnetwork/build/releases). There is no
store listing. The Snap was dropped on 2026-08-05 in favour of native packages
plus an AppImage (see `APPIMAGE.md`, `MIGRATION.md` and `PLAN.md` §4, M4).

## Architecture

The GUI and the daemon are separate processes, which mirrors the Windows
app's service split. `MIGRATION.md` is the normative contract for paths,
binary names and artifact names.

```
  unprivileged desktop user              root, systemd (urnetworkd.service)
  urnetwork-gui                          urnetworkd
    gtkmm4 + libadwaita, SNI tray          no GUI dependencies
    urnet::DeviceRemote ── device RPC ──▶  urnet::DeviceLocal (rpc=true)
                   (127.0.0.1:12025, mTLS, while the tunnel is up)
    control client ──── unix socket ────▶  control server
                   (/run/urnetwork/control.sock, SO_PEERCRED)
                                           Tunnel: /dev/net/tun, ip routes and
                                             rules, resolvectl DNS, nftables
                                           urnet::newIoLoop(device, tunFd)
                                           GeoClue /etc/geolocation write
```

- The **daemon** is started by systemd (`Type=notify`). It opens and configures
  the tunnel and holds the SDK's `DeviceLocal`. It keeps its own traffic out of
  the tunnel with a cgroup-BPF socket mark plus nftables, and it refuses to
  start a tunnel when that cannot be proven. It depends only on gio/glib,
  nlohmann_json, threads and the SDK. It is built on Ubuntu 22.04, so it runs
  on glibc 2.35 or newer.
- The **GUI** does the sign-in, the UI and the tray. It has no privilege and
  reaches the daemon over the control socket. Tunnel control is authorized by
  polkit (`packaging/polkit/com.bringyour.network.policy`), or by membership in
  the `urnetwork` group on hosts without polkit.
- `/usr/bin/urnetwork` is a launcher script installed by the daemon package.
  It is the `Exec=` target of the desktop entry, the `urnetwork://` scheme
  handler and autostart. It runs the first GUI it finds, in this order:
  `$URNETWORK_APPIMAGE`, `~/.local/lib/urnetwork/URnetwork.AppImage`,
  `~/Applications/URnetwork*.AppImage`, `/usr/lib/urnetwork/URnetwork.AppImage`,
  `urnetwork-gui` on `$PATH`, then the `com.bringyour.network` Flatpak. The
  autostart entry runs it with `--autostart`, which it hands to the GUI as
  `URNETWORK_AUTOSTART=1`: that launch shows only the tray icon, and every
  other launch shows the window.
- One GUI instance runs per session. A launch that finds it running hands
  itself over (the window shows, or the link opens) and exits; a launch that
  finds it quitting waits for it to end, then starts.

## Excluding an app from the tunnel

`urnetwork-exclude <command> [<argument>...]`, installed by the daemon package,
runs a command and everything it starts outside the tunnel: its traffic leaves
through the physical network, and the kill switch does not block it, while
everything else stays in the tunnel. The command runs in the user's systemd
slice `urnetwork-exclude.slice`, and urnetworkd lets that slice out only for the
user who started the tunnel. It needs systemd and the cgroup v2 unified
hierarchy and refuses on other hosts. Start the app this way while it is not
already running: an app that hands its window to an instance that is already
running stays in the tunnel with that instance. On a systemd-resolved host the
command's name lookups still go through the tunnel's DNS, so while the kill
switch blocks the machine after a drop it can connect but not resolve names.

In the app, Settings > Connections > Exclude apps from the VPN lists the
installed apps. Turning one on writes a copy of its launcher, "<App> (outside
VPN)", to `~/.local/share/applications`, which starts the app through
`urnetwork-exclude`; the app's own launcher is unchanged and stays in the
tunnel. The copy handles no file or link types, so opening a link never starts
it. Flatpak and Snap apps are not listed: `flatpak run` and `snap run` move the
app into a systemd scope of their own, out of the slice. The row is hidden
where `urnetwork-exclude` is not installed or the host is not on the cgroup v2
unified hierarchy.

## Stack

**C++17 + GTK4 (gtkmm-4.0) + libadwaita**, on top of the shared **cgo SDK**
(`libURnetworkSdk.so` plus the header-only `urnetwork_sdk.hpp` C++ wrapper).
The Windows app uses the same SDK surface. Build: meson + ninja.

## Features

- Sign in with Google or Apple (in the system browser, returning through
  `urnetwork://`), email or phone and password, a seed phrase, an auth code, a Bittensor or Solana wallet, or an instant (guest)
  account. Also sign-up, verification, password reset, and upgrading a guest
  account.
- Connect: best available or a chosen location or provider, a globe view,
  connection details (contracts, transport, DNS, split rules) and a kill switch.
- Provide, extender share and import (QR), and location override (GeoClue).
- Account, earnings, points and leaderboards, the Solana payout wallet,
  referrals, redeem codes, upgrade (Stripe checkout), support, settings and
  licenses.
- Tray icon (StatusNotifierItem + `com.canonical.dbusmenu` over raw GDBus),
  hide-to-tray, and launch on system startup (a Settings switch that links
  the autostart template into `~/.config/autostart`; a login then shows only
  the tray icon).
- Localized with gettext. `app/po/` is generated from the shared localization
  store and is never edited by hand.

## Build (local dev, on Linux)

```bash
cd app

# 1. vendor the SDK (from a local zip or SDK_ZIP_URL); produces
#    third_party/urnetwork-sdk/{amd64,arm64}/{libURnetworkSdk.so,urnetwork_sdk.hpp}
scripts/fetch-deps.sh /path/to/URnetworkSdkLinux.zip

# 2. configure, build, test
meson setup build -Dsdk_arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
meson compile -C build     # build/urnetwork-gui and build/urnetworkd
meson test -C build
```

`URnetworkSdkLinux-<version>.zip` is attached to every release on
urnetwork/build. You can also build it from `sdk/cgo` (`make build_linux`).

GUI dev dependencies (Ubuntu 24.04, the oldest Ubuntu that packages GTK4 for
C++): `g++ meson ninja-build pkg-config gettext libgtkmm-4.0-dev
libadwaita-1-dev libsecret-1-dev libzxing-dev libglib2.0-dev
nlohmann-json3-dev`. `libzxing-dev` (zxing-cpp 2.1 or newer) decodes the
extender share QR from an image file; the encoder is vendored in
`app/third_party/qrcodegen`. `libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev` is optional: with it the
upgrade sheet embeds the Stripe checkout, and without it the checkout opens in
the system browser.

The daemon alone builds without any GTK. With the default `-Dgui=auto`, a
machine without gtkmm/libadwaita builds only `urnetworkd`, which needs
`g++ meson ninja-build pkg-config gettext libglib2.0-dev nlohmann-json3-dev`.
Pass `-Dgui=enabled` to make a missing toolkit an error. Other options are in
`app/meson_options.txt` (`app_version`, `glibc_floor`,
`walletconnect_project_id`, and `host_integration=false` for the GUI-only
Flatpak).

The GUI does not run a tunnel itself. To try a dev build, install a released
daemon package (or run `packaging/tarball/install.sh`), then start the GUI
with the vendored SDK on the library path:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=third_party/urnetwork-sdk/$(dpkg --print-architecture) ./build/urnetwork-gui`. The GUI reports when the daemon is unreachable or out
of date. For host checks, run `sudo urnetworkd --diagnose` and
`sudo urnetworkd --selftest-egress`. `sudo urnetworkd --revert` lifts the
firewall and routes if a machine is left blocked.

## Release artifacts

`build.sh` runs the same build as the release pipeline
(`build/all/build-linux.sh`, driven by `build/all/run.sh`) on a macOS host.
First the cgo SDK is cross-built with zig. Then, per arch, one Docker image
builds the daemon packages on Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35 floor) and another
builds the GUI AppImage on 24.04. `build/all/linux/verify.sh` checks the
artifacts in the container. The Flatpak is built afterwards in its own
container (`build/all/linux/build-flatpak.sh`).

Per release (names are normative, see `MIGRATION.md`):

| Artifact | For |
|---|---|
| `urnetwork-daemon_<v>_<amd64\|arm64>.deb` | daemon: Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives |
| `urnetwork-daemon-<v>.<x86_64\|aarch64>.rpm` | daemon: Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE |
| `urnetwork-daemon-<v>-<x86_64\|aarch64>.pkg.tar.zst` | daemon: Arch, CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Manjaro |
| `urnetwork-daemon-<v>-<amd64\|arm64>.install.tar.gz` | daemon: any systemd distro without one of the above (e.g. immutable or read-only `/usr` hosts) |
| `URnetwork-<v>-<amd64\|arm64>.AppImage` | GUI, every distro |
| `URnetwork-<v>-<arch>.flatpak` | GUI, Flatpak. Built for the build host's architecture only (currently arm64) |

You need a daemon package and one GUI. Publishing to an apt/dnf repository is
still a manual follow-up; today everything ships from the GitHub release.

## Updates

The GUI checks for updates itself (`app/src/UpdateChecker.cpp`): thirty seconds
after launch, at most once every six hours, and from the Developer page's
"Check for updates" button. Settings > General > "Check for updates
automatically" turns the timed checks off. The check reads the official
[urnetwork/linux releases](https://github.com/urnetwork/linux/releases) (the
nightly `urnetwork/build` releases are never consulted), skips drafts and
prereleases, and compares the release tag `v<version>` with the running
version by its release code.

What the app does with a newer release depends on how it was installed:

- **AppImage** — Settings shows "Update available" with an **Install** button.
  Install downloads the own-architecture `URnetwork-<v>-<arch>.AppImage` to a
  temporary file beside the running one, verifies its SHA-256 against the
  digest GitHub publishes for that release asset, makes it executable and
  renames it over the running file (the previous file is kept as
  `<name>.AppImage.bak` until the next launch). **Relaunch** then starts the
  new file. Nothing that fails the digest check is ever installed or kept. If
  the AppImage's folder is not writable (for example a root-owned
  `/usr/lib/urnetwork/URnetwork.AppImage`), the verified file is saved to the
  Downloads folder instead and Settings shows where.
- **deb / rpm / Arch / install tarball / Flatpak** — Settings shows "Update
  available" with the release page and the file to download for this install
  plus its package-manager command (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `flatpak`, or the
  tarball's `install.sh`). The app never elevates and never runs a package
  manager.
- **Daemon install tarball, from a shell** — `sudo urnetwork-daemon/install.sh
  --update` (run from any extracted tarball) asks the GitHub API for the latest
  stable urnetwork/linux release, downloads its
  `urnetwork-daemon-<v>-<arch>.install.tar.gz`, verifies the SHA-256 against
  the asset digest GitHub publishes, and runs that tarball's installer. It
  fails with a clear message when there is no stable release or the release
  has no tarball. `--url <url>` (optionally `--sha256 <hex>`) uses a specific
  tarball instead. `packaging/tarball-update.test.sh` covers it.

The daemon package and the GUI update independently; a GUI newer than the
daemon shows the "service out of date" state until the daemon package is
updated. The AppImage carries no embedded zsync update information: GitHub
Releases cannot serve the multi-range requests zsync needs, so there is no
`.zsync` sidecar and `appimageupdatetool` does not apply.

## Supported distros

The daemon needs systemd, glibc 2.35 or newer, cgroup v2, cgroup-BPF,
`nft`, `ip` and `/dev/net/tun`. systemd-resolved is needed for tunnel DNS and
for the kill switch. The released AppImage takes glibc and libstdc++ from the
host and is gated at glibc 2.39 (it is built on Ubuntu 24.04). The tray needs a
desktop with StatusNotifierItem support. The measured host is Bazzite (Fedora Silverblue base). Other
distros are packaged but, per distro, only inferred to work.
`docs/DISTRO-SUPPORT.md` lists every host assumption and how to test it.
`docs/TESTING-CACHYOS.md` is a step-by-step test guide for Arch-based systems.
