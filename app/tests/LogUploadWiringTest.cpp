// The call sites of "send feedback with logs" while disconnected (support inbox
// 2090). The lifecycle is pure and tested in LogUploadTest.cpp, the wire in
// ControlProtocolTest.cpp; what makes the daemon upload its own logs with no
// tunnel, behind the log's gate, on a device that touches nothing else, off its
// main loop and one at a time — and what makes the GUI ask it first, fall back
// to its old path and learn the outcome from status — lives in the daemon and
// the GUI, which need glib, GTK and the SDK. So this reads their sources: a
// decision with no caller is this project's most-repeated defect.
