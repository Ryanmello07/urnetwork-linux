// UpdateChecker -- the in-app updater (windows App/UpdateChecker.{h,cpp}
// parity, the Linux half).
//
// ONE worker thread polls the official release list (ReleaseSelection.hpp
// names the repo; nothing else does), decides with the pure SelectRelease,
// and publishes a Snapshot to ONE handler on the GTK main loop. Checks run
// thirty seconds after launch when the persisted six-hour throttle says so,
// every six hours while the app lives, and on the developer screen's button.
// The "check automatically" preference (Settings) gates the timed checks
// only; a manual check always runs and reports. No check, manual or timed, is
// sent while GitHub has asked this network to wait (UpdateSchedule.hpp).
//
// WHAT AN APPLY DOES depends on how the GUI is installed (DetectInstallKind):
//
//   AppImage   download the own-arch AppImage to a dot-file BESIDE $APPIMAGE,
//              verify its SHA-256 against the release asset's digest, chmod
//              +x, keep the running image as <APPIMAGE>.bak and rename the
//              new file over $APPIMAGE (atomic: same directory), then wait for
//              the user's Relaunch click, which execs the new file. The .bak
//              is removed by the NEXT launch -- proof that the new image
//              starts. When $APPIMAGE's directory is not writable (the
//              package-managed /usr/lib/urnetwork copy, a root-owned ~/Apps)
//              the verified file lands in the Downloads folder instead and
//              the notice names it.
//   everything else
//              no download at all: the notice names the release page, the
//              asset for this install and the package-manager command. The
//              app never elevates and never runs a package manager.
//
// NOTHING THAT FAILS ITS DIGEST IS EVER INSTALLED OR KEPT ON DISK.
