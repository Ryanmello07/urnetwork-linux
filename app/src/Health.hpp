// THE ONE CONNECT READING — the whole of what pane A's status row is allowed
// to say, computed in one pure function from one snapshot.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The hero used to be written from THREE copies of the
// connection state, each with its own writer, its own freshness and its own
// meaning:
//
//   ConnectPage::connected_    <- MainWindow::SetConnected(SdkHost::Connected())
//   ConnectPage::stats_.connected <- LiveStats, and only while the window was
//                                 visible (MainWindow.cpp gated ApplyStats on
//                                 windowVisible_, and did NOT gate the status
//                                 push beside it)
//   ConnectPage::connectStatus_ <- SdkHost's ConnectionStatusHandler push
//
// and the branch that printed "Connected" required TWO of them to agree while
// the branch that printed "Connecting to providers" required the third to hold
// a particular string. Three fixes rearranged those three copies; none of them
// asked what the copies MEAN. They mean this:
//
//   * ConnectViewController::GetConnected() (sdk/connect_view_controller.go:154)
//     returns `self.connected`, and `self.connected` is written in exactly one
//     place — ConnectLocationChanged (:116-125). It is "a destination is
//     SELECTED". It is NOT "providers are attached". LiveStats::connected is a
//     copy of it (SdkHost::ReadStats), and SdkHost::Connected() is that same
//     bit ANDed with "a DeviceRemote is bound over the current control
//     session".
//   * SdkHost's ConnectionStatusHandler — the feed that wrote connectStatus_ —
//     emits exactly TWO strings from its five call sites: "DESTINATION_SET"
//     and "DISCONNECTED". It NEVER emits CONNECTING, CONNECTED or
//     CONNECT_FAILED, so `status == "CONNECTING"` and the whole CONNECT_FAILED
//     branch were unreachable, and DESTINATION_SET — which stands for the
//     ENTIRE life of a carrying session, because the destination stays
//     selected while the tunnel carries — was being read as "in flight".
//
// So none of the three inputs could tell "connecting" from "connected", and
// the one signal that can — ConnectViewController::GetConnectionStatus(),
// which is CONNECTING until the provider window reports MinSatisfied and
// CONNECTED after (connect_view_controller.go:1055-1063) — was fetched into
// LiveStats::connectionStatus and then never read by the status writer.
//
// This header takes the fixed vocabulary instead:
//
//   sessionUp  = a destination is selected AND the daemon's tunnel is still
//                ours. There is something to disconnect from.
//   sdk        = the connect controller's OWN status. CONNECTED is the only
//                token that means providers are attached.
//
// and returns text, dot, hero pose and button action TOGETHER, in one value,
// so no caller can take them from different readings. That is the property the
// four reports were about; it is not a fourth condition.
//
// Pure C++17 on purpose — no GTK, no SDK, no glib. It is a decision table, and
// it is exercised without a display by app/tests/HealthTest.cpp.
