// The login's browser round trips and the user coming back from one. Google,
// Apple, Solana and the Bittensor wallets sign in through the browser (or a
// wallet app) and answer only through the urnetwork:// deep link. While one is
// in flight every sign-in affordance is disabled (MainWindow::SetLoginBusy),
// and a browser the user closed sends nothing, so without this the buttons
// stayed disabled until the app quit.
//
// Coming back to the app is the flow being over from the user's side: the
// window enables the affordances again, but leaves the SDK attempt armed. A
// late completion still lands (SdkHost matches its state and nonce), and a new
// click supersedes it through SdkHost's wallet flow counter. There is no
// reliable "browser closed" signal, so cancelling here could only kill a flow
// still open in another tab.
//
// Two things are not a return. The Bittensor manual sheet is the flow itself,
// in the app: closing it answers the attempt, so the gate stays armed while it
// is open. And closing one of the app's own dialogs (the Solana and Bittensor
// choosers start these flows) can drop the app's focus for a moment before
// the main window takes it back: only an absence of kMinAwayMillis counts.
//
// Header-only and free of GTK (tests/BrowserSignInGateTest.cpp). Not thread
// safe: the window uses it on the GTK main loop only.
