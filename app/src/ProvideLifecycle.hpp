// Whether this device provides, connected or not, for each provide control
// mode — the one lifecycle decision the GUI and the daemon both apply to the
// provider-only device (support inbox 1521, P008: providers get no traffic).
//
// The defect this answers. Since the daemon split the provider is the daemon's
// DeviceLocal, and that device was built only inside a tunnel session
// (TunnelHost::RunStart). Disconnect sends stop_tunnel (it has to: the capture
// routes would otherwise blackhole the machine, linux 1dbec0d fix 3), and
// stop_tunnel destroys the DeviceLocal, so on Linux the provider stopped in
// every mode the moment the user disconnected — and never started at all after
// a launch without auto-connect. A user who picked "Always" earned only while
// connected and was told nothing. The single-process app before the split did
// not do this: its Disconnect left the device running.
//
// What the other platforms do. Android and Apple keep their packet tunnel, and
// with it the DeviceLocal, running whenever providing is enabled
// (VpnServiceStartPolicy.kt vpnServiceRequired, VPNReconciliationSupport.swift
// VPNDesiredState.shouldRun: provideEnabled || connectEnabled || !routeLocal),
// and the sdk decides the tier. Linux keeps the DeviceLocal without the tunnel:
// while disconnected the daemon runs a provider-only device with no tun, no
// capture routes, no DNS change, no nftables change and no device RPC listener,
// so providing never changes how this machine's own traffic is routed.
//
// The SDK semantics, mirrored and never reinterpreted
// (DeviceLocal.applyProvideControlModeWithLock, sdk/device_local.go):
//   never   -> no providing
//   always  -> public
//   network -> network (the user's own devices), connected or not
//   auto    -> public while connected, network while not
//   anything else -> no providing (the sdk's conservative default)
// "manual" defers to an explicitly set provide mode that lives in the device,
// which does not exist while disconnected; this app never offers it (the
// Connect page and onboarding offer auto/always/network/never), so it is
// treated like any other unknown mode and gets no provider-only device.
//
// Pure and header-only (C++17, no GTK, glib or SDK): tests/ProvideLifecycleTest.cpp
// runs it on any host, ControlProtocol.hpp validates start_provider with it and
// TunnelHost retires the provider-only device with it. The tail of the file
// paces how the GUI reads that device's statistics (provider_stats) and how
// long the daemon keeps polling its provider status, and decides where the
// Extender switch reads and writes its setting while disconnected.
