// The daemon's tunnel core: DeviceLocal(enable_rpc=false, then setRpcServer
// with the client's pinned mTLS material — see RunStart) + /dev/net/tun +
// urnet::newIoLoop + the nftables leak floor, lifted from the GUI
// SdkHost::StartTunnel at the daemon split (linux/MIGRATION.md). The Linux
// analogue of the Windows Service/TunnelController: the GUI's DeviceRemote
// reaches this device over the SDK's loopback mTLS RPC once Start() succeeds.
//
// Owns the persisted device identity (Ed25519 client key seed + provide TLS
// cert/key) under the daemon state dir (/var/lib/urnetwork): it is
// device-scoped, not session-scoped, so peers keep verifying this device
// across daemon restarts and GUI re-logins. Only an explicit identity wipe
// rotates it — and, since the audit, a FAILED restore never rotates it either.
//
// THREADING — this changed, and the change is the point:
//   * Start/Stop/SetProvideMode/SetKillSwitch and the two glib callbacks
//     (the reaper tick, the systemd-resolved name watch) all run on the daemon
//     MAIN LOOP. The control server serializes request handling, so they never
//     overlap each other.
//   * The bring-up itself (network space import, DeviceLocal construction —
//     a network round trip — tun open, ~35 subprocesses) may run on a WORKER
//     thread when the client sends async=true, so the control loop stays
//     answerable while it runs. Without that, a start slower than the client's
//     30 s receive timeout made the client reconnect and re-send start_tunnel,
//     which used to tear the half-built session down and start again: a
//     restart loop on exactly the slow networks where the timeout fires.
//   * opMutex_ guards the session objects (device_/ioLoop_/tunnel_/filter_).
//     The main-loop callbacks only ever TRY-lock it, so a slow bring-up can
//     never block the loop.
//   * statusMutex_ guards ONLY the published StatusReply, so `status` answers
//     in microseconds at every phase of a bring-up.
//   * The SDK IoLoop done callback runs on an SDK thread and does nothing but
//     publish; the real teardown (and arming the kill switch on an unexpected
//     drop) happens on the reaper tick, on the main loop, where it is safe.
//   * StartProvider runs on the main loop too and only try-locks opMutex_. The
//     provider-only device it builds never coexists with a tunnel session's:
//     every teardown, and so the head of every bring-up, retires it first.
//     ProviderStats, which reads that device's view controllers for the GUI,
//     only try-locks it as well.
//   * UploadLogs runs on the main loop and only try-locks opMutex_; a request
//     that finds a bring-up is queued and the reaper starts it. The sdk's
//     upload (the zip and the post) runs on a thread of its own
//     (logupload::Flight), which touches nothing of this object but the
//     device's handle; the device stays alive until that call returns
//     (ReleaseDeviceLocked). The upload's callback ends the upload in the
//     flight; the reaper retires the standalone device.

  // rather than written straight into status_ so the lifetime is stated once
  // and in one shape: ONE site sets them (the up edge in RunStart), two clear
  // them (Start's transition to Starting and StopInternalLocked's tail), and
  // Status() assembles them into every reply the way it already assembles
  // owner_connected.
  //
  // NEITHER IS MINTED HERE, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN DECISION. Both arrive on the
  // accepted start_tunnel and are LATCHED: instance_id is the device pairing
  // key this DeviceLocal was constructed with, and rpc_session_id is the name
  // the GUI gave the credential generation it minted — in the same act, from
  // its own CSPRNG, and stored with it (metadata in a 0600 file, the client key
  // and pinned server cert in the Secret Service).
  //
  // Minting the session id daemon-side was considered and rejected. The client
  // has to persist the name BESIDE the half of the mTLS material that never
  // leaves it; a name invented after the tunnel is already up arrives too late
  // for that record, so the GUI would have to write it twice and would hold a
  // credential it cannot name if it died in between. What the daemon owes
  // instead is that the name always describes THIS session, and that it changes
  // whenever the material does:
  //   * set in the same locked block that publishes Up, so no client can read
  //     Up with a half-empty identity;
  //   * cleared on every teardown and at the head of every bring-up, so a
  //     stopped or starting tunnel names nothing and an attach cannot match it;
  //   * never re-pointed at different material while it is live — CanAdopt
  //     compares the name along with the material, and a start_tunnel that
  //     re-uses the live name with a different generation is refused
  //     (ControlServer::HandleStartTunnel, kCodeTunnelAlreadyRunning).
