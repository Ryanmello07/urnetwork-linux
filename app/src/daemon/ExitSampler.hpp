// The dead-tunnel failsafe's view of the SDK (TunnelWatchdog.hpp): a thread of
// its own that asks a session's device for its exits and its window status
// every kSdkSampleIntervalMillis, publishes what the last completed sample
// said, and tells the device when the physical network changed.
//
// A thread, not the reaper, because every one of those calls can block on the
// device's state lock while the reaper runs on the main loop that answers
// `status` and reaches the failsafe's verdict. A sampler stuck inside the SDK
// is what the SdkUnresponsive rule detects, by its silence, so it must never be
// waited for, and the main loop must never be the thread that is stuck.
//
// It never touches the session's urnet::DeviceLocal object. It holds the
// device's C handle by value and calls the C ABI with it: the SDK never reuses a
// handle (cgo/handles.go), so after the session releases its device a late call
// resolves nothing and returns empty, and a call already inside the SDK keeps
// the Go object alive by itself. Stop therefore only cancels. A sampler still
// inside a call comes out of it later and touches nothing but its own shared
// block, which it owns a share of.
//
// Start, Stop, Read and NoteNetworkChange are called under TunnelHost's
// opMutex_; the published readings are atomics and a kick is a flag, so none of
// them waits for the sampler.
