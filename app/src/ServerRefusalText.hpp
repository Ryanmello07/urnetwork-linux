// What the upgrade sheet and Manage subscription say when the server refuses
// to start a checkout or to open the billing portal (UpgradeSheet.cpp
// RequestSession, AccountPage.cpp OpenCustomerPortal; ur.io
// src/lib/paymentFailure.js parity).
//
// The server refuses with a stable error.code beside its English message
// (server PurchaseErrorCode* for POST /stripe/create-checkout-session,
// SubscriptionErrorCode* for POST /stripe/customer-portal). The rule is
// ur.io's:
//   - a code with a line of its own reads as that line alone:
//     already_subscribed, plan_unavailable and checkout_unavailable from the
//     checkout session, no_customer and store_unavailable from the billing
//     portal;
//   - invalid_request and start_failed read as the screen's own line alone (a
//     request this app got wrong, or a start that did not happen and can be
//     tried again);
//   - any other code, or none (a server from before the codes), reads as the
//     screen's own line with the server's words on the line under it.
// guest_sign_in_required never gets here: the upgrade sheet opens the add
// sign-in flow first (GuestConversion.hpp PurchaseRefusalFor), and the billing
// portal does not send it. Nor does a request that got no answer (the SDK's
// error string), which is not a refusal and reads as it always did. Codes
// compare exactly, as the server spells them.
//
// Dependency-free so tests/ServerRefusalTextTest.cpp runs it without GTK or
// the SDK.
