// The out-of-balance notice: what the drawer banner says and when the desktop
// notification is posted and withdrawn.
//
// Out of balance is a billing state, not a dropped tunnel. While a connection
// is requested the tunnel keeps capturing with no provider behind it, so the
// user is told that their traffic is held and that Disconnect releases it.
// Nothing here ever disconnects: the notice only informs, and the user's own
// Disconnect (MainWindow::ToggleConnect) is the one way out.
//
// An episode starts when insufficient balance is first seen and ends when it
// clears. The notification is posted at most once per episode, at the first
// observation where the gate holds and a connection is requested (a Pro plan
// or a balance poll at entry defers it). It is withdrawn when the episode ends
// or the connection is no longer requested; a disconnect does not re-arm it
// within the episode.
//
// A new connect is a different matter: with no balance it is blocked and the
// entry point shows the upgrade path instead (DecideStartConnect, below). That gate
// only ever applies to starting a session, never to one that is already up.
//
// Pure and dependency-free so tests/InsufficientBalanceNoticeTest.cpp runs
// without GTK. Not thread safe: driven from the GTK main loop only.

// the user asked for that the balance blocked recovers by itself
// (BalanceRecovery): a start the gate refused waits with the press (the retry
// the gate was handed), and a requested connection held out of balance waits
// too. Every reading and balance change is fed in, and once the available
// balance is back at kRecoveryThresholdBytes the connect is retried: the
// refused press runs again past the gate, or the held connection is rebuilt,
// which asks for new contracts and drops the latched status a held connection
// that sends nothing never clears. The same rules as android
// BalanceRecovery.kt.
//
// The retry is bounded:
//   - Once per recovery. A block arms it, and so does a reading below the
//     threshold; a retry disarms it. Only a reading fetched at or after the
//     arming counts, so a balance read before the block never retries.
//   - At most kRecoveryMaxRetries in a row. A new ask from the user refills
//     them, and so does a connection that stays out of the block for
//     kRecoveryBudgetResetMillis after a retry.
// It never connects a user who did not ask: only a refused press or a
// connection already requested is retried, and the user's Disconnect, another
// connect, a sign-out or Cancel ends the wait (Clear).
