// What the app says about the daemon's dead-tunnel failsafe (TunnelWatchdog.hpp):
// the warning under the connect controls while a countdown runs on the live
// session, and the line after the failsafe ended one, in the two versions that
// differ on what matters: with the kill switch on the machine is still blocked,
// with it off it is back on the internet, unprotected. Windows' connect page
// says the same in the same words (ConnectPage::ApplyConnectStatus).
//
// And the tray's two recovery items, Windows' TrayIcon's: the tray is the one
// surface left while the window is closed to it, so it is where a machine the
// daemon still captures, or that the kill switch blocks, can be given back
// from.
//
// GTK-free, so every case is a table test; the surfaces translate each key and
// its English with T_.
